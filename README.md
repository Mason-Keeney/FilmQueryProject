# FilmQueryProject

### WEEK 7 Weekend Project Skill Distillery

## Description
The FilmQueryProject uses the sdvid mysql database in order to provide a user feedback based on their input. A user can enter an ID or a Keyword/Phrase to find a Film. After a valid prompt is entered the terminal displays the Film's Title, Release Year, Rating, Language, Description and Cast List. The user is then prompted to either return to the main menu or show the films full details. If a user elects to show the details they will then have the opportunity to continue finding films in the selected manner (i.e. by ID or by keyword/phrase) or return to the main menu.

## Request for Follow-up
SD Teachers:
I wrote 9 additional JUnit tests for this project. Please take a look at a couple of those test and let me know what opportunities there are for better tests, or if more in-depth tests would be beneficial. Specifically, I tested whether or not a valid object was returned, but not that every field in each object was filled in correctly. Is it typical to test if each field is filled correctly when working via Test-Driven-Development, or would the tests as written be considered sufficient?
